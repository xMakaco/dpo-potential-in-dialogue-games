"""
Branching game runner for exploring multiple trajectories.

This module provides functionality to run games with branching, where at certain decision points
the game state is copied and multiple different responses are explored independently.

Key concepts:
- **Branching factor**: Number of parallel branches created when the condition is met
- **Branching condition**: A callable that determines when to create branches
- **Leaf branches**: The final completed game trajectories (e.g., 64 independent gameplays)

The runner maintains a flat pool of active environments. At each step:
- Every active environment is checked against the branching condition
- If the condition is met, the environment is copied branching_factor times
- Each copy is then stepped forward independently

Use cases:
- Collecting multiple model responses for the same context
- Exploring different dialogue paths
- Generating diverse training data
- Stochastic evaluation with repeated sampling

    Run game instances with optional branching to explore multiple trajectories.

    This function executes games where, at certain decision points determined by the
    branching_condition, the game state is copied and multiple different responses
    are explored in parallel. This creates a tree of game trajectories.

    Args:
        game_benchmark: The game benchmark configuration

        callbacks: Callbacks for benchmark lifecycle events
        branching_factor: Number of branches to create when condition is met.
            - 1 = no branching (default, standard gameplay)
            - 2+ = create this many parallel branches at each branching point
        branching_condition: A callable(player, env, context) -> bool that determines
            when to branch. If None, no branching occurs. Default: always True.
            - player: The Player object (access to model, role, etc.)
            - env: The GameMasterEnv (access to game state, round, etc.)
            Returns True to trigger branching at this step.
        reward_func: a callable (observation, action, state, info) -> float to compute the reward signal.
            Defaults to outcome-based rewards: 1. on success, 0. on failure, -1. on abort, 0. otherwise.
            Game-specific rewards can be implemented by subclassing GameState to carry additional fields
            (e.g. letter matches in Wordle) and reading them in a custom reward_func.
        feedback_func: an optional callable (observation, action, state, info) -> str | None to provide
            qualitative language feedback. When provided, the result is stored in info["turn_feedback"]
            and can be used by the training loop (e.g. as a verbal reward signal).
    Returns:
        None. Results are saved via callbacks.

    Example:
        # Branch when the Describer role is active
        run(..., branching_factor=3, branching_condition=is_player_role("Describer"))

        # Branch when a specific model is active

        # Branch only at first round

        - With branching_factor=N and M branching points, you get N^M leaf branches

        - Branching creates deep copies of the game state, so branches don't interfere
        - Use **_ in lambda conditions to ignore unused parameters
