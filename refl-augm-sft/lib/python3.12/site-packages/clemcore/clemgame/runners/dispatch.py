        The dispatch run method checks if batchwise processing is possible:

        - If (a) all models support batching and (b) batch size is >1, then will delegate to the batchwise runner.
        - Otherwise, will delegate to the sequential runner.

        If you want to have more control over the runner selection, then invoke them directly.

        Note: Slurk backends do not support batching, hence will run always sequentially (for now).
