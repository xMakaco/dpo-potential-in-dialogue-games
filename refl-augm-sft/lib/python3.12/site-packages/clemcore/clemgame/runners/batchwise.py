class DynamicBatchDataLoader(Iterable):
    """
    A custom DataLoader for stateful IterableDatasets that supports dynamically shrinking batch sizes.

    This loader is designed for datasets where sources may be independently exhausted over time,
    such as multiple concurrently running environments or game sessions. It preserves the internal
    iterator state of the dataset and gracefully adjusts batch sizes as fewer data sources remain active.

    Key Features:
        - Supports stateful datasets (e.g., those that resume iteration across calls).
        - Adapts batch size dynamically: yields smaller batches as individual data sources are exhausted.
        - Compatible with custom collate functions for flexible batching.
        - Suitable for use cases like streaming rollouts (e.g., SinglePassGameSessionPoller).

    Note:
        The final batch in a polling round may be smaller than the specified `batch_size`, especially
        when few data sources remain. Fixing this to always yield full batches would require additional
        buffering and coordination logic, which is intentionally avoided here to keep the implementation simple.

    Unlike PyTorch's built-in DataLoader, this implementation:
        - Avoids resetting dataset iterators on each pass.
        - Handles partial batches naturally without requiring drop_last logic.
