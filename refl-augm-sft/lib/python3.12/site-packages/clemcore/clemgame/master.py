        Checks if a player response is applicable (w.r.t game state) and valid (w.r.t. game rules).

        Implements effects that an applicable player's response has on the game world, that is,
        advancing the game by using the player's response to update the game state.

        For example:
            - set the response as the context for the another player to respond to via set_context_for(other_player, response) and let _should_pass_turn() return True
            - set an adjusted context for the current player and give the current player an additional turn by letting _should_pass_turn() return False
